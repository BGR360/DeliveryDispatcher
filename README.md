# DeliveryDispatcher
The Delivery Dispatcher Android App is a useful tool for restaurant employees.

## Overview

I created this app to help me out with my part-time job as a Delivery Dispatcher for Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. On busy nights, many delivery orders are placed in a very short amount of time, and it was my job to group orders together in an efficient way and assign them to delivery drivers on staff.

This app allows the user to place multiple pins on the same map, which is extremely useful for visualizing a large number of delivery orders. The markers are labeled (I made use of the [Android Maps Utils library](http://googlemaps.github.io/android-maps-utils/) to label the markers. The coolest part is that you can change the colors of the markers to denote order grouping, and this really helped me be a more efficient worker at the pizzeria.

## The Code

This repo does not actually contain the correct code that runs what you see in the screenshots. This is the code from when a friend and I tried to revamp my original side project into a more robust app. The screenshots and demo video that you see is from the original side project, which is on my old computer. I may upload that one to GitHub soon.
